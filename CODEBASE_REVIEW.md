## Conclusion

With the security enhancements now completed, we've made significant progress on the initial implementation priorities. The next focus areasâ€”internationalization, user experience improvements, mobile responsiveness, documentation, and build optimizationsâ€”will further enhance the application's quality and maintainability.

Each of these tasks has been broken down into manageable steps that can be systematically implemented. By addressing these areas, we'll continue to improve the codebase's structure, performance, and user experience while ensuring it remains maintainable and scalable for future development.
