## Project Structure

### Directory Organization

- **src/components/**: UI components organized by feature/purpose
  - Feature-specific directories for related components
  - Feature-specific subdirectories (`/sections`, `/cards`, etc.) for organization
  - Common UI components in `src/components/ui`
- **src/hooks/**: Custom React hooks
  - General hooks directly in this directory
  - Feature-specific hooks in subdirectories
  - Core hook functionality in `/core` subdirectories
  - Hook utilities in `/utils` subdirectories
- **src/context/**: React context providers
- **src/utils/**: Utility functions organized by domain
- **src/pages/**: Page components that utilize components
- **src/types/**: TypeScript type definitions and interfaces
- **src/services/**: API clients and service integrations
- **src/constants/**: Constant values and configuration
- **src/assets/**: Static assets like images and icons

### Component Composition Guidelines

- Break complex interfaces into smaller, focused components
- Use composition over inheritance
- Keep component files under 200 lines of code
- Extract reusable UI patterns into shared components
- Follow atomic design principles:
  - Atoms: Basic UI elements (buttons, inputs)
  - Molecules: Simple component combinations
  - Organisms: Complex UI sections
  - Templates: Page layouts
  - Pages: Complete interfaces

### File Organization Standards

- Group related files in feature directories
- Place shared utilities in appropriate utility folders
- Keep test files adjacent to their implementations
- Use index files for clean exports
- Maintain clear separation of concerns:
  - Components: UI and presentation logic
  - Hooks: Business logic and state management
  - Utils: Helper functions and utilities
  - Types: Type definitions and interfaces
  - Constants: Configuration and static data

## Component Architecture

### Component Types

1. **Presentational Components**:
   - Focus on appearance

2. **Container Components**:
   - Manage data fetching and state
   - Connect to data sources (contexts, services, etc.)
   - Pass data to presentational components
   - Handle business logic
   - No direct styling

3. **Layout Components**:
   - Manage the arrangement of other components
   - Handle responsive layouts
   - Example: `DashboardLayout`, `CardLayout`
   - Focus on structural organization

4. **Feature Components**:
