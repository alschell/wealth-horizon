## Project Structure

### Directory Organization

- **src/components/**: UI components organized by feature/purpose
  - Feature-specific directories for related components
  - Feature-specific subdirectories (`/sections`, `/cards`, etc.) for organization
  - Common UI components in `src/components/ui`
- **src/hooks/**: Custom React hooks
  - General hooks directly in this directory
  - Feature-specific hooks in subdirectories
- **src/context/**: React context providers
- **src/utils/**: Utility functions organized by domain
- **src/pages/**: Page components that utilize components
- **src/types/**: TypeScript type definitions and interfaces
- **src/services/**: API clients and service integrations
- **src/constants/**: Constant values and configuration
- **src/assets/**: Static assets like images and icons

### Module Structure

- One component/hook/utility per file
- Index files for convenient exports
- Group related files in appropriate feature directories

## Component Architecture

### Component Types

1. **Presentational Components**:
   - Focus on appearance
   - Don't connect to data sources directly
   - Receive data via props
   - Minimal state (UI state only)

2. **Container Components**:
   - Manage data fetching and state
   - Connect to data sources (contexts, services, etc.)
   - Pass data to presentational components

3. **Layout Components**:
   - Manage the arrangement of other components
   - Handle responsive layouts
   - Example: `DashboardLayout`, `CardLayout`

4. **Feature Components**:
   - Self-contained feature implementations
   - May compose presentational and container components
   - Example: `MarketOverview`, `CashflowSummary`

### Component Guidelines

- Keep components focused and small (under 200 lines of code)
- Use named exports for components
- Implement prop validation with TypeScript interfaces
- Memoize expensive components with `React.memo`
- Use function components with hooks over class components
- Extract complex logic to custom hooks
- Implement error boundaries for critical UI sections

## State Management

### Local State

- Use `useState` for component-specific state
- Use `useReducer` for complex state logic

### Context API

- Use for sharing state that multiple components need
- Keep contexts focused on specific domains
- Provide well-documented provider components

### Form State

- Use specialized form hooks for form state management
- Implement consistent validation patterns

## Styling Standards

- Use Tailwind CSS for styling components
- Follow a mobile-first approach for responsive design
- Use CSS variables for theming
- Follow BEM-like naming for custom CSS classes
- Use component composition for styling variants

## TypeScript Standards

- Use explicit type annotations for function parameters and return types
- Create interfaces for component props
- Use type guards for runtime type checking
- Avoid `any` type unless absolutely necessary
- Use generics for reusable components and functions
- Export types and interfaces for use across the application
- Prefer interfaces for object types that will be extended
- Use type aliases for union types, function types, and mapped types

## Error Handling

- Implement consistent error handling with error boundaries
- Use try/catch blocks for async operations
- Provide user-friendly error messages
- Log errors appropriately (without exposing sensitive information)
- Use centralized error handling utilities

## Form Handling

- Use controlled inputs for form elements
- Implement consistent validation logic
- Provide clear error messages for validation failures
- Use form hooks for complex forms
- Implement consistent submission handling

## Testing

- Write unit tests for utility functions
- Write component tests for UI components
- Implement integration tests for critical features
- Use mock services for API-dependent tests
- Maintain high test coverage for critical code paths

## Performance Best Practices

- Use memoization to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Implement virtualization for long lists
- Optimize image loading with lazy loading
- Use code splitting for route-based chunks
- Minimize dependencies and bundle size
- Cache expensive calculations

## Code Formatting

- Use ESLint for code linting
- Use Prettier for code formatting
- Enforce consistent indentation (2 spaces)
- Enforce consistent line length (80-100 characters)
- Use semicolons at the end of statements
- Use single quotes for strings
- Add trailing commas for multiline arrays and objects

## File Naming Conventions

- Use PascalCase for component files (`Button.tsx`, `UserProfile.tsx`)
- Use camelCase for utility files (`formatDate.ts`, `useFormSubmit.ts`)
- Use kebab-case for CSS module files (`button-styles.module.css`)
- Use uppercase with underscores for constant files (`API_ENDPOINTS.ts`)
- Use `.tsx` extension for files with JSX
- Use `.ts` extension for pure TypeScript files

## Documentation

- Add JSDoc comments for functions and components
- Document complex algorithms and business logic
- Keep README files updated
- Document API integrations and data flows
- Use inline comments for complex code sections
- Create architecture diagrams for complex features

## Version Control

- Use feature branches for new features
- Use descriptive commit messages
- Reference issue numbers in commit messages
- Conduct code reviews for all changes
- Maintain a clean main branch
- Use semantic versioning
