A comprehensive wealth management platform built with React, TypeScript, and Vite.

## Setup Instructions

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install

2. Make sure the following dependencies are installed:
```bash
npm install lucide-react vite @vitejs/plugin-react
# or
yarn add lucide-react vite @vitejs/plugin-react
# or
pnpm add lucide-react vite @vitejs/plugin-react
```

3. Start the development server:
